# CIFAR-10 Image Classifier with Streamlit

This project trains a convolutional neural network (CNN) on the CIFAR-10 dataset using data augmentation and multiple convolutional layers. The trained model is saved and used in a Streamlit app for interactive image classification.

## Usage

1. Train the model (optional if `cifar10_image_classifier.h5` is provided):

2. Run the Streamlit app:

3. Drag and drop images in the app to get predictions.

## Dependencies
